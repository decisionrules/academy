# Workflow

## Workflow Basics

Workflows represent a new feature category within DecisionRules, enhancing the platform's capabilities. They integrate seamlessly with existing rules, maintaining a familiar structure. Workflows are built by placing nodes on a canvas and connecting them with lines, with various node types available.

### Creating Your First Workflow

To start, click the **Create** button in the main menu and select the **Workflow** tab. You can choose to create a blank workflow (check the[ Workflow Limits](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MN4F4-qybg8XDATvios/workflow/workflow-limits) page if needed). After creation, you’ll see a blank workflow Designer. Review the settings, similar to other business rules, and then move to the **Designer** tab.

### The Workflow Designer

The Designer features a canvas with a single **Start** node. On the right side, you’ll find several tabs, with the **Palette** being the most important for now. The Palette lists all available node types with brief descriptions. To use a node, simply drag it from the palette onto the canvas.

Once a node is on the canvas, click it to open its detail settings. Each node type has different configuration options depending on its functionality. For detailed information on each node type, check the [**Workflow Nodes Overview**](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MN4F4-qybg8XDATvios/workflow/workflow-nodes-overview).

With the tutorial below you will be able to create a simple workflow and discover node types within Workflow.
