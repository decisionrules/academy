## Benefits of a codeless solution

Many organizations use code-based rules. Thus, when any change is made to the logic or individual values such as insurance rates or seasonal sale discount code, a Business Description needs to be created by the development team who then implement the change in production. Such a change can take several days and requires a whole team of developers to implement it. But what if there was a way to transform your business logic into rules without having to use any code? Automate your processes with <mark style="color:purple;">DecisionRules</mark>. Create, deploy and manage your Business Rules thanks to our user friendly UI.

## Rule types

Currently there are six different types of rules in the engine: Decision Tree, Decision Table, Lookup Table, Scripting Rule, Decision Flow, and Integration Flow. One of our popular rules, the Rule Flow, is accessible but it has been improved by the new flows, Decision and Integration.&#x20;

Each type correspond to different levels of logical complexity and different types of decision. Depending of the process you want to automate you choose one rule or another. The criteria for this selection comes from experience, but for now feel free for experiments with all of them. A more detailed explanation will be found below in the [RULES](https://academy.decisionrules.io/rules/what-is-a-rule) section.&#x20;

## Delivery of new rules or changes using versioning

With versioning, you can work on or use multiple versions at the same time. While your current version is in production, you can be already working on new versions that include changes or fixes to your logic. You can change the content of all versions separately and test them independently.

## DecisionRules Deployments Options

The easiest way to start using the <mark style="color:purple;">DecisionRules</mark> application is by using the Public Cloud. This Software as a Service (SaaS) solution, with global coverage and low response time, is ready to use in 2 minutes. All you have to do is create an account to use it. You can also use Regional Clouds, where you get all the benefits of Public Cloud with the guarantee of data residency in the region. You can choose from the following regions - European Union, The United States and Australia.

Another option is to use Private Managed Cloud, where the cloud instance is dedicated exclusively to you. You choose your favorite cloud provider (Amazon, Microsoft or Google) and tell us your performance requirements. Based on all your requirements, our certified professionals will build the environment for you. Another advantage is the availability of Single Sign On (SSO) options.

The last option is Private Cloud or On Premise. <mark style="color:purple;">DecisionRules</mark> can be deployed directly to your infrastructure either in your private cloud or on your own servers. Advantages are data privacy and residency, SSO and absolute control of your environment.
