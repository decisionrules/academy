# Roles

Use Roles to assign specific permissions to the users invited to your space. There are two ways to assign roles, you can either create a new custom role for the user or use one of our predefined roles. In addition, when creating new roles, you can use the predefined roles as templates that you copy to modify just a part of the permissions. See below for more details on the two types of role.

You can find role settings and assignment of roles under "Access" in the left sidebar menu of your Space settings.

By assigning a role, you determine how individual users can interact with your space, your decision rules and other features. To assign a role to a user click on the 'Role' dropdown list next to the user’s name.

## Predefined roles

A user with the <mark style="color:purple;">Admin</mark> role is allowed to perform all activities in the space and has access to all rules and features. The <mark style="color:purple;">Editor</mark> has the same rights as the Admin except for setting up the space, managing users, and deleting API Keys. <mark style="color:purple;">Reader</mark> is allowed to just view the data and settings in each feature.

## Creating a new role

As mentioned, you can create new user roles for your project. You can create them in two ways. You can also edit the permissions of these roles at any time.

One way is by copying one of our predefined roles, where you can modify part of the permissions. In the example below, a new role similar to the Editor will be created, but the user will only be able to work with decision table rules.<br>

The other way is to create a completely new role where you customize the permissions as needed. For example, you can create a new role where the user is only allowed to work with Decision Trees, plus they can change the space settings.

If you no longer need them, you can delete any roles except the predefined ones. Click the ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/deleterolebtn (1).png>) button next to the selected role and confirm to delete the role.
