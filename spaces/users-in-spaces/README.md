# Users in Spaces

Work with your employees and colleagues in your Spaces and create dynamic environments. Thanks to the accessibility within <mark style="color:purple;">DecisionRules</mark>, you can create teams that work together independently of where your colleagues are.

Invite other users into your spaces and assign roles with permissions to create efficient workflows.

In the following sections, you will find information about inviting other users and creating and managing roles with specific permissions.

* [<mark style="color:purple;">**Invitations**</mark>](how-to-invite-a-new-user.md)
* [<mark style="color:purple;">**Roles**</mark>](roles.md)
