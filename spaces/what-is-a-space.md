# What Is a Space

Spaces can be thought of as work areas, containing projects linked by a particular logic. Usually, spaces are used to define teams and connect different departments. Invite your colleagues to collaborate on your Space and assign roles and permissions to create seamless workflows for your projects.

_The number of Spaces and Rules you can create, the users you can invite is determined by your Subscription._
{% endhint %}

## First steps

In order to create your business rules you will need your workspace. One Space will be automatically created when you register your account, so you can start transforming your business logic into decision rules right away.

## Space description

Each Space has its own dashboard, its own API keys, and its own business rules. Each Space is operated by users with specific roles and generates audit logs for individual rules, in addition, relevant information about the Space can be saved and manage.
