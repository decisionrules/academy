# How to change your subscription

## How to access your plan any time

To change your plan, you must first log into your account. At the bottom of your Space, click on the "Profile" button and select your Username. Your profile page will then appear. Click "Plans" on the left-hand side to see the available plans.

## How to change your subscription when the rule limit is reached

Running out of space? Once you have reached the limits of your plan, an "Upgrade" button will appear on your profile page Dashboard. Clicking "Upgrade" will redirect you to the plans page, where you can easily choose a higher plan to fit your business needs.

## Changing the plan

On the page of available plans, you can find your current plan alongside others, each with a description. Select the plan you wish to change to and click on the "Select Plan" or "Get a Quote" button. You can also check your current limits and permissions in the "Limits" section on the left-hand side of the page.&#x20;

You will need to finish setting up your profile. Once you have done this, fill out your payment details within the pay-gate and click the "Pay and subscribe" button.

After a successful payment you will be redirected back to the plan page. Now your plan has been changed and a new invoice was created. Click the “Invoices” button to see all your invoices.

_When a plan is changed to a higher plan, the higher plan takes effect immediately. If the plan is changed to a lower plan, the lower plan will not take effect until the next billing period._
