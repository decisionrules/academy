# Plans

<mark style="color:purple;">DecisionRules</mark> offers a range of subscriptions. These plans come with defined limits, such as the number of rules you can create, the workspaces you can manage, and the users you can invite to collaborate with you. However, we understand that as your business logic expands, so do your requirements. When you reach these limits, you can seamlessly transition to a higher subscription plan that better matches your evolving needs, with just a few clicks.

In the following sections, you can find information about the plans, their limits or how to change your existing plan:
