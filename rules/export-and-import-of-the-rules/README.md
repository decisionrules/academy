# Export & Import of the Rules

Export and import comes in handy if you want to move rules between spaces, add new rule versions, or create entirely new rules. For example, if you export decision tables in XLSX or CSV format, you can easily store data in your decision tables using Excel or Google Sheets. Or you can use a file import to create new rules in your spaces.

See the sections below to discover ways to migrate your rules between your spaces or environments.
